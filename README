NAME
       hier - overview of the filesystem layout

DESCRIPTION
       On Mutiny, a filesystem layout is used that attempts to both preserve
       relative compatibility with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, while
       also making it a priority to reduce cruft, legacy, and other
       unnecessary redundancy where possible.

   Hierarchy
       The following is a sketch of the filesystem hierarchy.

       /
           The root of the filesystem. From here, all flows forth. This is
           additionally the root user’s home directory.

           /boot
               Files used during the boot process, such as boot loader
               configuration, kernel executables, initramfs archives, and so
               on. If running on an EFI-enabled system, this whole directory
               should be mounted on an EFI partition.

           /bin
               Binaries installed on the system by the package manager,
               praxis(7), or through some other system-managed method.

           /dev
               Device files. This structure is first populated by devtmpfs[1]
               at boot, and then after boot, managed by mdevd(8).

           /etc
               System configuration. This directory is first populated by
               tendency-config-populate(1).

               ksh/
                   Files relating to ksh(1).

                   •   rc - Startup file for ksh(1), sourced by /etc/profile.
                       See profile(7).

               fstab
                   Filesystem table. It is for specifying what filesystems can
                   be mounted, and it’s used by commune-init(8) and mount(8)
                   to mount your filesystems at boot. See fstab(5).

               group
                   A list of groups on the system. See group(5).

               hosts
                   A table of IP addresses associated with hostnames. See
                   hosts(5).

               issue
                   A file containing the message shown prior to the login
                   prompt, printed by getty(8).

               passwd
                   A list of user accounts on the system. This should be
                   readable by all users. See passwd(5).

               profile
                   A sh(1) script ran for login shells. See profile(7).

               shadow
                   A "shadowed" passwd file: that is to say, it contains
                   encrypted passwords, while /etc/passwd does not. Fittingly,
                   it should not be readable by anyone except root. See
                   shadow(5).

               shells
                   A list of the shells a user can have as their login shell.
                   See shells(5).

           /home
               Non-system users' home directories. Usually all non-system
               users will have a directory under this one as their home
               directory.

           /include
               Header files for C and C++ libraries installed by the package
               manager, praxis(7), or through some other system-managed
               method, used by their respective compilers, cc(1) and c++(1).

       /lib
           Libraries and other non-user-facing executables installed by the
           package manager, praxis(7), or through some other system-managed
           method.

NOTES
       1. devtmpfs does not currently have a manual page, and documentation of
       it in the kernel is slim. See CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
       in the kernel configuration to see descriptions of what it does.
