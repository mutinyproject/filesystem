.SH "NAME"
profile \- files used for the startup of login/interactive shells
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
When a shell is started, a few files get read. The order used on Mutiny systems is documented here,
and the default actions of the profile files given is explained here.
.SS "Order"
.sp
If the shell is a login shell, the following files are read:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
\fI/etc/profile\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
\fI/share/profile.d/*.sh\fP \- system\-maintained profile files installed by the package manager,
praxis(7).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
A shell\-specific, admin\-managed profile:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
On ksh(1), this is \fI/etc/ksh/profile\fP.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3

On sh(1), this is \fI/etc/sh/profile\fP.
.RE
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 4." 4.2
.\}
\fI~/.profile\fP. If a shell is not a login shell, no further files are read.
.RE
.sp
If the shell is an interactive shell, the following files are read:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
A shell\-specific, admin\-managed rc file:
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
A user\-maintained, shell\-specific rc file:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
On ksh(1), this is either \fI~/.kshrc\fP or \fI~/.config/ksh/rc\fP. \fI~/.kshrc\fP takes priority.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
On sh(1), this is either \fI~/.shrc\fP or \fI~/.config/sh/rc\fP. \fI~/.shrc\fP takes priority.
.RE
.RE
.sp
On both ksh(1) and sh(1), the file that will be used is specified via the $ENV environment variable.
See their respective manuals for details on that.
.sp
Lastly, if it is an interactive login shell, both sets are read in the order they are listed.
.SS "Purpose"
.sp
TODO(somasis): describe what all the disparate files actually do
.SH "GLOSSARY"
.sp
interactive shell
.RS 4
A shell that is started for the purpose of running commands. That is, it prints a prompt, the
user is expected to be typing commands into it and so on. This corresponds to the \fB\-i\fP flag.
.RE
.sp
login shell
.RS 4
A shell started with the \fB\-l\fP flag, or with its argv[0] starting with a dash.
Less obtusely, this means a shell started by a variety of methods:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
By a user logging in via login(1), from a virtual terminal
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
By a user logging in via ssh(1), interactively
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

Some terminals can spawn login shells if you tell them to.
